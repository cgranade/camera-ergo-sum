The **Camera Ergo Sum** campaign is based on the [FATE Core RPG]() ruleset, with a few modifications to help fit the world of the Historians. In particular, Camera proceeds in a sequence of story arcs called _dives_, each of which takes place in a different simulated world. As players descend into each dive, they build their projection into that simulation as a second FATE character that is their avatar in that world.

> Alice's _primary character_ Starlight joins the rest of the party diving into _The Borrowed Tomorrow_, a simulation of a 1970s era park themed around a future that never came to pass. In the world of _The Borrowed Tomorrow_, Starlight takes on the projection of Janet, a visitor to the park hailing from New Jersey.

When playing Camera, players generally control both their primary character, and their primary character's projection in whatever simulation they are currently diving into. To represent this, players will have two FATE character sheets. For the most part, everything follows the same as base FATE Core, with the projected character taking the place of most skill, stunt, and aspect use, but we describe the differences here.

## Stress tracks and Consequences

Primary characters have the two typical Stress tracks (physical and mental), while projected characters have only one: the synchronization Stress track (sync Stress for short). The sync Stress track represents how well each player character is synchronized with their projection, and with the simulation as a whole.

Consequences are similar, except that projected characters have no extreme Consequence slot; they utilize their corresponding primary character's extreme Consequence slot instead. Forcing yourself to stay in a traumatic projection can cause long-term negative effects for Historians.

> What Janet sees in the hall of mirrors shakes her deeply, revealing a self that she would much rather have denied. The whole experience deals 4-shift of mental damage to Janet. Unfortunately, Janet is already in fairly bad straights, having spent her sync Stress track, and her 2-, 4-, and 6-shift Conseqeunce slots. Having no other option to stay in _The Borrowed Tomorrow_, Starlight decides to take a new Extreme Consequence, _Haunted by the Self in the Mirror_, replacing one of Starlight's previous Aspects. Taking this consequnce allows her to stay in the dive as Janet.
>
> The GM can invoke this new Consequence to compel Starlight or her projections to reflect on what horrible vision her choices could lead towards. Only by coming to terms with her own agency and the existential dread that it brings can Starlight spend a Major Milestone to begin healing from her experiences diving into _The Borrowed Tomorrow_.

If a projected character is out of sync Stress and Consequences boxes, and cannot buy off remaining synchronization damage, then they are Taken Out as per typical FATE Core rules. Aside from exceptional circumstances, being Taken Out means being forcibly disconnected from the dive; this process deals 6-shift mental damage to the primary character.

## Skills

The real world and each simulation have their own Skill list, similar to FATE Core campaigns on the whole. Primary characters may only draw their skills from the real world list, while projected characters may only draw their skills from the list for the simulated world to which they belong. How each Skill is used depends on which lists it appears on:

- Real world only: The Skill can be used by the primary character on behalf of their projection.
- Both lists: The Skill is used at the rating of the projected character, but cannot differ from the primary character by too much (see _Conceptualization_, below).
- Simulated world only: The Skill is used by the projected character only.

### Conceptualization

One Skill on the real world list deserves special mention: Conceptualization. This Skill affects how well the Historian can affect their projection in during a dive.

- **Overcome**: TODO
- **Create Advantage**: TODO
- **Attack**: Cannot be used.
- **Defend**: Cannot be used.

Additionally, Conceptualization affects how much a player's primary and projected characters Skills may differ. In particular, the sum of the differences between all Skill ratings that are on both the real and simulated worlds cannot exceed the primary character's Conceptualization.

> Starlight has a Good Conceptualization (+3), so her skills may vary from her projection by at most three points. Starlight has an Physique of 2, while Janet has a Physique of 3, costing one point of difference. Similarly, Starlight has Great Athletics (+4), while Janet has only Fair (+2), allowing Janet to spend her Skills on other parts of 1970s life. This is a total of three differences, so Starlight and Janet cannot differ any further on those Skills available to both lists.
