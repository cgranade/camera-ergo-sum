Notes:
- Contacts cannot be taken above a Fair (+1) in this dive.
- Pilot follows the same mechanics as Drive, but the Hard to Shake Stunt does not apply.
- Science follows the same mechanics as Lore, but is restricted to those academic pursuits that are relevant to life onboard _Utopia_. Each primary character's Lore is still used for other topics.
