## Aspects

- *High concept*: Obsessive Apprentice with a Mission
- *Trouble*: We Must Not Forget
- Got to Take Matters Into My Own Hands
  > When I was a young seeker, some of the other youth stole one of my sister's most prized possessions, a book from the world that came before. If any adult knew I had it, there's no way I could keep it— a book is far too valuable to trust to a child. Rather than tell our elders, I took matters into my own hands, investigating until I found out who stole my book. In the cover of night, I snuck into their tent and made sure that my sister's book was back where it belonged.
